//Write a program that asks the user for a number, 
//then shows the multiplication table for this number.

let number = Number(prompt("give me the number"));

for (i =0; i <=10; i++){
  let multiples = number * i;
  console.log(multiples);
}

When you are done, improve the program so it only accepts numbers between 2 and 9 (use the previous exercise as a blueprint).
